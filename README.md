# Awesome Vue Boilerplate

> This is an ever-evolving, very opinionated architecture and dev environment for new Vue SPA projects using [Vue CLI 3](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli). Questions, feedback, and for now, even bikeshedding are welcome. ðŸ˜„ If you'd like to increase the time I can spend on this project, as well as other Vue resources.

## Features

- [**Thorough documentation**](#documentation): Written with the same care as Vue's core docs to quickly train new team members and consolidate knowledge.
- [**Guaranteed consistency**](docs/linting.md): Opinionated linting for Vue, JavaScript/JSON, SCSS, and Markdown, integrated into Visual Studio Code and run against staged files on pre-commit.
- [**Speedy development**](docs/development.md): Between [configurable generators](docs/development.md#generators), [handy aliases](docs/development.md#aliases), and [global base components](docs/development.md#base-components), your productivity will skyrocket.
