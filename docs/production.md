<!-- # Building and deploying to production

- [Coming Soon](#coming-soon)
  - [From the terminal](#from-the-terminal)
  - [From Circle CI](#from-circle-ci)

## From the terminal

```bash
# Build for production with minification
yarn build
```

This results in your compiled application in a `dist` directory.

## From Circle CI

Update `.circleci/config.yml` to automatically deploy to staging and/or production on a successful build. See comments in that file for details. -->
